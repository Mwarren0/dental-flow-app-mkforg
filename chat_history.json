You're looking to build a comprehensive mobile app for your dental care consultancy, essentially a POS (Point of Sale) management system tailored to your specific needs. Here's a plan for the initial version of the app:\n\nFeatures for the First Version:\n\n- Patient Management: A core feature will be the ability to add, view, and edit patient information. This will include details like contact information, medical history, appointment schedules, and billing information.\n- Procedure Management: You'll need a way to define and manage the various dental procedures offered at your consultancy. This will involve creating a catalog of procedures with descriptions, pricing, and associated codes.\n- Appointment Scheduling: A calendar or scheduling system to book, reschedule, and manage patient appointments. This should integrate with the patient management feature to easily assign appointments to specific patients.\n\nDesign Elements:\n\n- Colors:\n    - Base color: Light blues and greens to evoke a sense of cleanliness and trust.\n    - Primary text color: Dark gray or black for readability.\n    - Accent colors: A brighter blue or teal to highlight key interactive elements.\n    - Highlight shades: Lighter shades of the base colors for backgrounds and subtle accents.\n- Typography:\n    - Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" for a professional and easy-to-read interface.\n\nLet's create an elegant and functional mobile app!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-01T06:21:07.700789"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a comprehensive dental care consultory management app. Let me first examine the current project structure and then create all the necessary components for your dental practice management system."}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "constants/Colors.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(index)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "styles/commonStyles.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now I'll create a comprehensive dental care consultory management app with all the features you requested.
